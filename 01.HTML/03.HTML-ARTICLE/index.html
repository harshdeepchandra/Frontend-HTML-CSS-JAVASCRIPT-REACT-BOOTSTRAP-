  <h4>Bugatti Chiron Super Sport</h4>
  <p align="justified">
    This car has a quad-turbo 8.0-liter W16 engine that generates 1,600 horsepower and 1,600 newton meters of torque. It has a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and can go from 0 to 400 kilometers per hour in 2.4 seconds. The top speed is electronically limited to 440 kilometers per hour.
  </p>
  <p>To allow for the lowest seating position, and lightest design, the TOURBILLON’s seats are fixed directly to the floor, with the pedals and steering wheel adjustable. Inspired by the world of top-tier motorsport, it provides the ideal combination of practicality and high-performance control.</p>
